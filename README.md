## Head and Tail

Little python challenge to reproduce the UNIX commands: head and tail and your
options -n and -r.

These scripts should read a file as input. Examples:

```bash
python head.py file_name.txt
```
```bash
python tail.py -n 15 file_name.txt
```

Both programs have unit tests

To run the tests:

```bash
make test
```
